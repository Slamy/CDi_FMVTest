# Lost Eden Music Player

The soundtrack of Lost Eden is stored as MPEG stream without any sector interleaving.
It is required to suspend and resume the CD reading for continuous playback.

This project is intended for stub loading with Lost Eden inserted in the drive.

It is possible to build an image if `EDMUSIC.RTF` from the game has been extracted via IsoBuster and copied into `build`
