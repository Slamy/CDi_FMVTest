# Lost Ride Ambience Seamless Experiment (failed)

Attempt to fabricate a PCL chain in memory to continuously play the rail road sound effect without pausing the playback.

This example works for 35 seconds and then stops working. Reason unknown.

This seems to be something rather advanced and experimental. Whether this was performed with a commercial title is unknown.
